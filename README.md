# 🏠 House Price Prediction – IBM Final Project

## 📌 Short Description
This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, the goal is to analyze housing data and predict house prices based on various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world housing data
- Explore trends and key features that affect house prices
- Build a simple predictive model (Linear Regression)
- Answer 10 guided analytical questions provided in the IBM final project
- Deliver actionable, data-driven insights for property value estimation

## 🗂️ Data Source

- **Dataset**: [King County House Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)  
- This dataset includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, USA.

---

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning (Linear Regression)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📈 Key Results / Insights

- Houses with **waterfront views** are priced significantly higher than those without.
- **Living area** (sqft_living) has the strongest positive correlation with price.
- **Renovated homes** tend to be valued higher, especially if the renovation was recent.
- The Linear Regression model achieved a decent R² score, showing that house price can be moderately predicted using the selected features.

# 🌟 Supermarket Santa Clara Data Analysis and Visualization

Welcome to the **Supermarket Santa Clara Data Analysis and Visualization** project, a personal data science project using real sales data from the company I currently work at. This project demonstrates the complete data wrangling and visualization workflow applied to actual business data, aimed at generating insights for sales performance and decision-making.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

As a data scientist at my company, the goal is to clean, transform, and visualize sales data to better understand product performance, pricing, and profitability.  
The dataset includes features such as:

- Product codes and descriptions  
- Unit costs and prices  
- Sales volumes  
- Margins and markups  
- Total costs and sales values

---

## 📥 About The Dataset

The data comes directly from the company’s sales records, extracted from internal systems. It represents detailed transactional information used for business analysis and reporting.

---

## 🔍 Key Tasks

### 📊 Data Wrangling & Cleaning
- Product descriptions translated through deep translator from Google Translator
- Handled inconsistent numeric formats (Brazilian style decimals and thousands separators)
- Converted data types to enable analysis
- Identified and filtered invalid or missing data rows

### 📈 Data Visualization
- Created interactive dashboards and plots to explore sales trends
- Analyzed product-wise and category-wise sales and profitability
- Presented clear visual insights to support business decisions

---

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`  
- **Data Cleaning:** String manipulation, type conversion, missing data handling  
- **Visualization:** Static and interactive plots for exploratory data analysis

---

## 📊 Outcome

This project enables stakeholders to understand sales dynamics, identify top-performing products, and monitor profit margins, contributing to more informed business strategies.
