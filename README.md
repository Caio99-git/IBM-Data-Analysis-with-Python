# 🏠 House Price Prediction – IBM Final Project

## 📌 Short Description
This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera. As a Data Analyst at a Real Estate Investment Trust, the goal is to analyze housing data and predict house prices based on various property features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess real-world housing data
- Explore trends and key features that affect house prices
- Build a simple predictive model (Linear Regression)
- Answer 10 guided analytical questions provided in the IBM final project
- Deliver actionable, data-driven insights for property value estimation

## 🗂️ Data Source

- **Dataset**: [King County House Sales dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)  
- This dataset includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015 in King County, USA.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- **Pandas** – data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning (Linear Regression)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Key Results / Insights

- Houses with **waterfront views** are priced significantly higher than those without.
- **Living area** (sqft_living) has the strongest positive correlation with price.
- **Renovated homes** tend to be valued higher, especially if the renovation was recent.
- The Linear Regression model achieved a decent R² score, showing that house price can be moderately predicted using the selected features.
